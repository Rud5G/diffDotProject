 * correctly.  In general if there is a difference between the from
 * version and the to version, then all updates should be performed.
 * If the $last_udpated is set, then a partial update is required as this
 * is a CVS update.  Make sure you create a new case block for any updates
 * that you require, and set $latest_update to the date of the change.
 *
 * Each case statement should fall through to the next, so that the
 * complete update is run if the last_updated is not set.
